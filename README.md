# Example app


 ## GOAL 
 
Introduce better control over navigation, sheet and feature-data handling using SwiftUI property wrappers only (Combine). 

## HOW

1) Create _NavigationControl_ instance and put source reference to features environment.
2) Create _SheetControl_ instance and put source reference to features environment.
3) Create _DataControl_ (features necessary and sufficient data - leave each view/viewModel to create all other data from it) instance and put source reference to features environment.
